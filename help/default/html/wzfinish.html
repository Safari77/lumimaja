<h1>Wizard Finish</h1>

<p>Whilst the selected function (Compare, Merge, Synchronize or Export) is in progress, this
page will show either the database being used (Compare, Merge and Synchronize) or the file
being written to (Export to Text or XML).  It will also display the progress by showing the
entry being currently processed (in the form
&#0171;Group&#0187;&nbsp;&#0171;Title&#0187;&nbsp;&#0171;User&#0187;). During this process,
neither the "View Report" nor "Finish" buttons will be enabled.</p>

<p>Once complete, you may view the report and/or exit the Wizard. From the View dialog, you
may save it to disk (it will be saved in the same directory as the current database)
and/or copy the contents to the clipboard. If saved to disk, you can view it again via the
<a href="view_menu.html">"View&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Reports"</a> menu. Note that when saved
to disk, it will overwrite any previous report file found in this directory for this function.
<span style="color=red;"><b>Note:</b> The report may contain sensitive data and care should be
taken when selecting the "save to disk" option.</span></p>
