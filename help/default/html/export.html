    <h2>Exporting Entries</h2>
    <p><b>Lumimaja </b> supports exporting (and importing)
of the stored passwords to (and from) various formats. To export
  password entries use the
"File&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Export To" menu. The supported formats are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#te">Plain text</a></li>
      <li><a href="#xml">XML</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For previous versions of <b>Lumimaja</b>, just select the
      desired
      format and specify the name of the database file you wish to
      create.</p>
    <p>In addition, to 'export' a subset of entries to another Lumimaja
      database,
      just start <b>Lumimaja</b> (assuming you permit multiple
      instances via
      <a href="system_tab.html">"Manage&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Options&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;System"</a>
      tab) and create a new database, whilst having your normal database
      open in another instance.
      Then you can simply drag and drop any entries or groups from your
      open database
      to this 'export' database.</p>
    <p>Export uses a Wizard interface. You may also select the Advanced
      field selection in order to restrict which entries you export and
      which
      field of these entries you export from your current database.
      See <a href="wzselectdb.html">here</a> for more details.</p>

<p>A report of the actions taken will be available on completion and this may be copied
to the clipboard or saved to disk as a text file in the same directory as the database.
The <a href="view_menu.html">"View&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;Reports"</a> menu item may then be
used to view the reports at a later date. The name of the report file is fixed and
dependent on the function that created it. If the same function is repeated
and its report saved to disk, any existing report for this function will be
overwritten. <span style="color=red;"><b>Note:</b> The report may contain sensitive data and
        care should be taken when selecting the "save to disk" option.</span></p>

    <p><b>Lumimaja</b> allows you to export password entries to
      text files.
      These files may then be used or modified by other applications.</p>
    <p>You will be asked to enter the master password (safe combination)
      to confirm that you may export the database into a clear text
      unencrypted file before you can export its contents. If you're
      using YubiKey authentication, click on the Yubikey button, then
      activate your YubiKey. You will also be required to supply the
      name of the new file and to confirm overwriting of it if a file of
      the same name if it already exists in the directory you specified.</p>
    <img alt="Export Text" src="images/export.jpg">
	<p><small><b>Note:</b> If you do not have a <a href="about_pws_yubi.html">YubiKey</a>, the screen shown above will not have the YubiKey
	button and text displayed.</small></p>
    <p>You can also specify some options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Password entries will be exported with a tab character between
        fields i.e., between the Group.Title, Username, Password and the
        Notes fields. The "Group.Title" is considered a single field.
        Any field containing a blank will be output inside double
        quotation characters. Only the Notes field can contain multiple
        line entries. The normal processing is to place each Notes line
        on a separate line in the exported text field. However, this
        makes it difficult to sort or to use when comparing two
        different export files. To overcome this, you may specify a
        delimiter to separate multiple lines when exporting them. If you
        are going to import a text file created with such a delimiter,
        then it must be specified, all the Notes lines will appear as
        one single line in the resulting database.<br>
        If required, tick that you want to put all separate lines
        in the Notes field onto one line and enter the character to be
        used as
        the delimiter. Since the whole Notes field is enclosed between
        double
        quotation marks, this character is prohibited from being
        selected as
        the multi-line delimiter.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img alt="Advanced Text Export Options" src="images/export_text_adv.jpg"></p>
    <p>Selecting "Advanced field selection" will display this Wizard
      page
      to allow you to export only some of the entries,
      based on the text in specified fields, and/or specify which fields
      are
      to be exported. See <a href="wzselectdb.html">here</a> for more
      details.</p>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<small><b>Note:</b> Details on the format of the exported text file may be found in the

    <h3><a name="xml"></a>XML</h3>
    <p>XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a popular format for
      transferring
      data between applications. <b>Lumimaja</b> can export (and
      import) the
      database entries to this format. The structure (or <i>schema</i>)
      against which the data is exported and validated is defined in the
      file <i>lumimaja.xsd</i>,
      which is provided as part of the distribution. This file is used
      by
      <b>Lumimaja</b> when XML data is imported, and should be
      provided to
      applications that wish to use the exported data.<br>
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

    <p>The display of XML files is specified by <i>lumimaja.xsl</i>
      - an eXtensible Stylesheet Language file. A sample file, which may
      be
      modified for your own needs, is supplied as part of the
      distribution.
      This file is only an example and you can easily modify it to
      display
      whatever fields you want to show. As this only displays the data
      and will not alter it, you will still be able to import it into
      <b>Lumimaja</b> at some later time.</p>
    <p>As in the Text Export option, you can control what entries and
      field to
      export to the XML file by selecting the "Advanced field
      selection".
      This will display the following Wizard page:</p>
    <p>
      <img alt="Advanced XML Export Options" src="images/export_xml_adv.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <p>Selecting "Advanced field selection" will display this Wizard
      page
      to allow you to export only some of the entries, based on the text
      in
      specified fields, and/or specify which fields are to be exported.
      <b>Note:</b>
      that the XML schema <u>requires</u> the Title and Password
      fields, hence these
      cannot be deselected. See <a href="wzselectdb.html">here</a> for
      more details.</p>
