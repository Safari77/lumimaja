Lumimaja - PasswordSafe with Argon2 KDF, data encrypted with AEAD
chacha20poly1305, proper error checking for corrupted or truncated databases.

To install:
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j4

Yubikey support (ykpers) is autodetected,
  "cmake -D NO_YUBI=1"
to disable it.

Argon2d is used, please read Argon2 spec what it means.
Argon2 specification can still change, I don't add compatibility code
for Lumimaja if it does.
