Lumimaja - PasswordSafe with Argon2 KDF, data encrypted with AEAD
chacha20poly1305, proper error checking for corrupted or truncated databases.
Unlike PasswordSafe V3 format, individial records are not written with
new random IV (TwoFish CBC mode), but all the records are written in one go
(simplified code a lot).

To install:
  mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j4
To change compiler:
  CXX=clang++ CC=clang cmake ..

Yubikey support (ykpers) is autodetected,
  "cmake -D NO_YUBI=1"
to disable it.

Argon2ds and Argon2id can be used as KDF, please read Argon2 spec what they mean.
Argon2 specification can still change, I don't add compatibility code
for Lumimaja if it does.

Lumimaja? My Finnish translation for "Snowden".
